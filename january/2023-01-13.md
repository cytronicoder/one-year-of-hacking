## Competitive programming

I started on Codeforces today ~~after a long time of procrastination and peer pressure~~. My plan is to do 2-3 problems a week, as I have school and other commitments. I could also possibly do more sometimes.

I have built a special folder for codeforces problems, which I will be using to store my solutions. additionally, I renamed my `cp` folder to `usaco` to make it more clear what the folder is for.

## School

I have a lot of assessments and exams coming up, so I'm going to be busy for the next few weeks. I'll try to keep up with my daily notes, but I might not be able to do so every day.
