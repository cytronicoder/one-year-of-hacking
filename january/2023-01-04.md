## ☁️ Google Cloud

Today, I will start working on the [Google Cloud Computing Foundations: Infrastructure in Google Cloud](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:GoogleCloud+GCCF2x+3T2022/home) course on edX. I'll probably finish it by the end of the week.

### Notes

- Storage options in the Cloud
  - Relational databases
    - Cloud SQL
    - Cloud Spanner
  - NoSQL databases
    - Firestore
    - Bigtable
  - World-wide object storage
- Use cases
  - Content storage and delivery
  - Data analytics and general compute
  - Backup and archival storage
- Structured and unstructured storage
  - Unstructured data
    - Documents
    - Images
    - Audio files
  - Structured data
    - Tables with rows and columns
    - Can be transactional or analytical workloads
      - Transactional workloads involve frequent reads and writes of data to keep records up to date
      - Analytical workloads involve data computation and analysis

| Storage option | SQL or NoSQL | Transactional or analytical | Local or global scalability |

| BigQuery       | SQL          | Analytical                  | /                           |
