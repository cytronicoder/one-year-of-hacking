## School

Well, I didn't manage to follow through with my plan to write a blog post a day for this week - there has been a lot going on, and I haven't had much time to work on it.

## Solana Core - let's chew some glass üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Today, I started working on the Solana Core program offered by buildspace. I'm really excited to learn more about how the Solana blockchain works, and I'm looking forward to building my own NFT marketplace on the Solana blockchain, as well as learning more about the Rust programming language and more!

### Notes

#### Reading and writing data to the blockchain

- To interact with the blockchain, we need to have a client (website, terminal, etc.)
  - Typescript node script
- All transactions go through an RPC (remote procedure call)
  - Gateway to the blockchain
  - Devnet, testnet, etc.
- Solana blockchain state
  - Everything is just an account under the hood!
- Accounts
  - Used for storage, contracts, and for native blockchain programs
  - Three types of accounts
    - Data accounts: store data
    - Program accounts: store executable programs (smart contracts)
    - Native accounts: core blockchain functions like staking and voting
  - Data accounts
    - System owned accounts
    - PDA (program derived address) accounts
  - Public key
    - base58 encoded string
    - address of the account

| Field        | Description                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lamports`   | The number of lamports owned by this account                  |
| `owner`      | The program owner of this account                             |
| `executable` | Whether this account can process instructions (is executable) |
| `data`       | The raw data byte array stored by this account                |
| `rent_epoch` | The next epoch that this account will owe rent                |

- Lamports
  - The smallest unit of currency in the Solana blockchain
  - 1 lamport = 0.000000001 SOL
