## üî¨ NUS Computer Science Research Week 2023

Day 2! Here are some notes from the second day.

### Talk 1: Physical-Layer Attacks and Their Impact on Wireless Networks: Two Case Studies

*Note: This talk was given by Prof. [Srdjan Capkun](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.capkun.html) from ETH Zurich. The website that he mentioned is [https://securepositioning.com/](https://securepositioning.com/).*

- UWB (Ultra-wideband) is a wireless technology that uses radio waves to transmit data
  - Commonly used in phones and vehicles
  - [Standard](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4z-2020.html)
- Low/high rate pulse (LRP and HRP)
  - Airtags, PKES (Passive Keyless Entry and Start) for cars, etc.

| LRP                                  | HRP                                          |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Binary frequency shift keying (BFSK) | BPSK (secure ranging) and BPM + BPSK (data)  |
| Requires few pulses (e.g. 100)       | Requires 1000s to 10000s of pulses           |
| 1 bit = 1 or more pulses             | 1 bit = multiple pulses                      |
| Stronger and spaced more apart       | More susceptible to inter-pulse-interference |

- Attacks
  - Decoding each pulse
    - Probability of attacker's success: $2^{-n}$
    - preamable + message (code)
    - Limited by power and noise (reliability)
- LRP with pulse reordering

### Talk 2: Causal Inference in Complex Networks

*Note: This talk was given by Prof. [Negar Kiyavash](https://people.epfl.ch/negar.kiyavash?lang=en) from EPFL.*

- Inference in complex network
  - Casual inference
- Measures of causality
  - Granger
  - Rubin causal model
  - Both measure if one variable causes another
- Network causal inference
  - Causal sufficiency (no latent nodes)
  - Passive and active learning
