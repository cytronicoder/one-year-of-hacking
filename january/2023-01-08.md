  - Challenges to data ingestion
    - Data can be streamed from many different methods and services
    - It can be hard to distribute event messages to the right subscribers
    - Data can arrive quickly and at high volumes
    - Ensuring services are reliable, secure, and perform as expected
  - Architecture
    - Upstream source data comes in from devices all over the globe
    - As a subscriber of Pub/Sub, Dataflow can ingest and transform those messages in an elastic streaming pipeline
    - Output the results into an analytics data warehouse like BigQuery
    - Finally, you can connect a data visualization tool or an AI or ML tool to explore the data to uncover business insights or help with predictions
