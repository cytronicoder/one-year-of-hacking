## Competitive programming

Today, I worked on two USACO problems:

- [Fenced In](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=623)
- [I Would Walk 500 Miles](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=946)

I particularly had a lot of trouble with the first problem, as the last test case always timed out with my program. I haven't figured out why yet, but I'll probably try to figure it out later.
