## School

Today is my first day back at my school after the winter break. I'm excited to see my friends again and to learn new things. I'm also excited to see my teachers again. I'm looking forward to a great year!

I didn't really learned much about Google Cloud Platform (GCP) today - I have a lot to prepare for my upcoming assessments and exams. I'm going to be busy for the next few weeks, but I'll try to keep up with my daily notes.
