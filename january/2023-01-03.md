## Competitive programming

Today, I worked on some USACO problems. I'm trying to get back into the habit of doing competitive programming problems every day. Today, I did the following problems:

- [Modern Art 2](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=743)
- [Dishwashing](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=922)

## Replit bounty

I started working on a bounty for someone on Replit today: [a web3 login page with transaction list and a meme.](https://replit.com/bounties/@timgrote/web-3-login-page-wit) I'll probably finish it by this week, but the hard part is probably managing my time rather than the actual coding.

You can see my progress on the bounty [here](https://github.com/cytronicoder/transaction-based-meme). I've already made a button that connects the user's wallet to the website, and I'm working on the transaction list now.

## ðŸ¤— Hugging Face course

Today, I'm taking a break from the Hugging Face course to work on the Replit bounty. I'll probably not do any more of the course until next week, since tomorrow marks day 1 of the [Computer Science Research Week 2023 @ NUS](https://researchweek.comp.nus.edu.sg/), and I'll be busy with that.
