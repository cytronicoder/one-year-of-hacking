## Meta AI's LLaMA language model

I am excited to say that I got access to Meta AI's LLaMA language model! It's really cool to see that they approved my request for access, as I never really thought that I would get access as a high school student. I'm really excited to see what I can do with this model, and I'm hoping to get some cool results.

You can check out my playground repository [here](https://github.com/cytronicoder/llama-playground).

## School

As always, I've been busy with school. I've been working on a few projects, such as the speech I mentioned in the previous post. I've also been working on a few other projects, such as a board game in design class that advocates for the issue of a lack of clean water in developing countries. Additionally, I've been learning about static electricity and Coulomb's law in science class.
